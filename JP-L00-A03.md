#### Can you think of an example of a microaggression that you have experienced, witnessed, or perpetrated? How did you handle it? Would you handle it the same way now?  
Where I went to high school (an international school overseas) asking someone where they were from was totally normal. I didn't realize until later in college that in the US that I realized that to an American POC this wasn't the innocent question that I meant it to be. No one ever got mad at me for it, it was more something I just realized over time, I simply just stopped asking unless it's relevant to the topic of conversation rather than a conversation starter.    
#### Knowing what we know about institutional oppression and the lack of diversity in tech, what would you like to see tech organizations and companies doing to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion?  
Honestly, as a white person I think we shoud ask those who are more effected by these issues and work hard to be an ally.
