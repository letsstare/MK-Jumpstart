#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I am keen on **Data Science:**

 - applying programming to research
 * user source informatics
 * community based research methodology and
 * programming apps for userablity  
 (specifically for those with disabilities and other socioeconomic factors that decrease accessibility)

I have the background skills and logical understanding to succeed in programming. I believe I can do a lot of good with an increased skill set. Washington is my home. It is where I was born and where I plan to spend my days. I love it here. I am not sure what to do with this quickly changing environment except to adapt. I am firmly rooted in making my home a better place through social justice activism. Programming being another tool that I can utilize, just as I have leveraged my experience in design towards my activism. I would do the same with programming.

I acquired my first computer when I was still very young, maybe 3rd or 4th grade. It attached to the TV and you could put in simple codes. I have always excelled at computers spending my recesses inside playing computer games to avoid bullies on the playground. When I was 17, 1996, I took a _Coreldraw_ design class. Shortly after, I learned _html_ and coded a website by hand for pay, this was circa 1998. I have been rebuilding computers and replacing hardware and software since around this time. Around 2001, I was learning how to _install Linux_ and a few years later I started teaching myself _Adobe_. Before I moved back to Seattle, I was working in Portland doing **Graphic Design** and **Video Production** utilizing the _Adobe Suite_ (mostly illustrator, Indesign, Photoshop and Premiere) as well as some other misc programs and **Website Development** utilizing graphic interfaces such as _dreamweaver, drupal and google sites and hand editing code._ I have been dabbling with online tutorials but I find them a bit slow and not engaging. I have the promise of a internship through [Apprenti](https://apprenticareers.org/) but I am unsure when or even if this will actually happen. I am also applying to [Outreachy.](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/)

I learn best in hands on environment and have been searching for such an environment that will support my gender nonconforming identity and not increase my already overburdening school debt.


#### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

One project I am currently working on is creating a [website](http://radicalcare.org) that has resources and can be downloaded to a phone so that users do not need to utilize their data plans in order to access. This is important because many trans folks have unstable jobs and housing and often do not have the ability to pay their phone bills which means their phones get cut off.

Most of the work I do is in the trans community and around HIV. At a panel discussion I organized this past year, one of the panelist made a comment that really made me think. She said "Why should someone care if they are HIV positive if they do not think they will be alive in five years?" Given this, it might make sense that I am not sure where I see myself in five years. I have a lot of intersectional identities. Society has told me that I should not have gotten this far nor even lived this long. I do know that everything I have learned thus far, I have utilized to great efficiency in my life. I know that learning to code will be no different.

I want to do research. I also recognize that the research I want to do will require programming skills. This might mean that I return to school for a PhD program. I am also comfortable sailing where the wind blows me. When sailing upwind, sometimes we have to do what is called tacking in other words the ship back and forth to use the wind to keep forward momentum. It is effective even if a bit slower than having the wind at one's back. So at some tie in the future I want to utilize apps such as the [website](http://radicalcare.org) referenced above to not only be a resource but a source of epidemiological public health data that can be mined on ways and methods to end health disparities. 



#### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program

I am nonbinary and that I was assigned female at birth. I do not feel that my gender has ever changed except in presentation. I do usually pass as a man even though that is not my gender identity. I have several trans men who are my friends, even my best friend, but I am not the same as them. They are dudes and I respect that. I also respect women's spaces and tend to not gravitate towards them as I am not a man but that doesn't mean that I am a women either and visa versa. ... I don't want to learn to code with a bunch of dudes, moreover I do not think I could.

More than anything, I identify as a feminist. So although I wear this cloak of maleness, I prioritize femininity. I prioritize femmes. I am aware of and recognize femmephobia. I prioritize what is classified as female communication even if it has never been innate to me. I have spent years learning how to talk about my feelings, engage in active listening, expressing empathy and lots of other techniques that I would rather call good interpersonal communication skills than feminine communication. I continue to work on these skills every day.

I have a lot of intersectional identities. I am mixed race and indigenous. I have mostly invisible disabilities. I am queer and transgender nonbinary. Most of the work I do, _for free_, as an activist revolves around these identities.

To see some of my skills and projects which show my commitment to social justice, check out:

* [Collective of Geniuses] (http://collectiveofgeniuses.org)
* [Rad Care] (http://radicalcare.org) (mentioned previously) and
* my [personal website] (http://smittybuckler.com) all of which I designed.   
*Note, I was upping my experience with wordpress with these sites, since that seems to be a staple for a lot of folks right now, but I am unhappy with the interface(s) which won't let me update the raw code and it is clunky.

#### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

At most recent job, which is all online, I excitedly typed a email to my new coworker. I did not think about what her communication style might be. She took the email to mean that I thought I was better or smarter than her somehow because I stated I just used a bunch of jargon, let me know if I can define any of it for you. I emailed her back and I let her vent about academia and then through discussion we came to a conclusion as to what she need in communication.

In the future, I will withhold my exuberance until I get a better hold on what people need in communication especially if we only communicate online.
